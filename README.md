📘 GradeBook Analyzer – Python Project
🧾 Description

The GradeBook Analyzer is a Python program that allows users to manage and analyze students’ marks efficiently.
Users can either enter marks manually or load them from a CSV file.
The program then calculates the average, median, highest, and lowest marks, assigns letter grades (A–F), shows pass/fail results, and displays the complete analysis in a neatly formatted table.

🎯 Features

Calculates key statistics (average, median, highest, lowest)

Assigns letter grades based on marks

Displays pass and fail students clearly

Presents all results in a clean, tabular format

Handles invalid marks and missing CSV files gracefully

⚙️ How It Works

Run the program – The main menu appears.

Choose an option:

1 → Enter student names and marks manually

3 → Exit the program

After entering or loading data, the program:
